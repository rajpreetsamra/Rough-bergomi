## Skew Term Structure

- **Objective**: Analyze how implied volatility skew evolves across time-to-expiry buckets.
- **Method**: Linear regression on IV vs log-moneyness for puts, aggregated over several dates.
- **Result**: Short-term options exhibit high skew variability; long-term smiles are flatter and more stable.
